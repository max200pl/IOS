# Bundle in Swift

## What is a Bundle?

A bundle is a directory with a standardized structure that holds executable code and the resources used by that code. Bundles are used to organize and package the resources of an application, such as images, sounds, and localized content.

## Bundle Types

- **Application Bundle**: The main bundle of an application that contains the executable code and resources.
- **Framework Bundle**: A bundle that contains a dynamic library and its resources. Frameworks are used to share code and
resources between applications.

- **Plug-in Bundle**: A bundle that contains code and resources that can be loaded dynamically at runtime. Plug-ins are used to extend the functionality of an application.
- **Document Bundle**: A bundle that contains a document and its associated resources. Document bundles are used to package documents in a standardized format.
- **Library Bundle**: A bundle that contains a static library and its resources. Library bundles are used to share code and resources between applications.

## How to use Bundles in Swift

- **Accessing Resources**: You can access resources in a bundle using the `Bundle` class. For example, to access an image in the main bundle, you can use the following code:

```swift
let image = UIImage(named: "imageName")
```
- **Loading Resources**: You can load resources from a bundle using the `Bundle` class. For example, to load a JSON file from the main bundle, you can use the following code:

```swift
if let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "fileName", withExtension: "json") {
    // Load the JSON file
}
```
- **Creating a Bundle**: You can create a bundle using the `Bundle` class. For example, to create a bundle for a framework, you can use the following code:

```swift
let bundle = Bundle(for: MyFramework.self)
```
