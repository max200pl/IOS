# Protocols in Swift

    Protocols are a powerful feature in Swift that allow you to define a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular task or piece of functionality. They can be adopted by classes, structures, and enumerations to provide a common interface.

## Defining a Protocol
```swift
protocol SomeProtocol {
    var property: String { get }
    func someMethod()
}
```

## Adopting a Protocol
```swift
struct SomeStruct: SomeProtocol {
    var property: String {
        return "Hello, Protocol!"
    }

    func someMethod() {
        print("Method from protocol")
    }
}
```
## Protocol Inheritance
Protocols can inherit from other protocols, allowing you to create a hierarchy of protocols.
```swift
protocol AnotherProtocol: SomeProtocol {
    func anotherMethod()
}
struct AnotherStruct: AnotherProtocol {
    var property: String {
        return "Hello, Inheritance!"
    }

    func someMethod() {
        print("Method from inherited protocol")
    }

    func anotherMethod() {
        print("Another method from protocol")
    }
}
```
## Protocol Composition
You can combine multiple protocols into a single requirement using protocol composition.
```swift
protocol FirstProtocol {
    func firstMethod()
}
protocol SecondProtocol {
    func secondMethod()
}
struct CombinedStruct: FirstProtocol, SecondProtocol {
    func firstMethod() {
        print("First method")
    }

    func secondMethod() {
        print("Second method")
    }
}
```
## Protocol Extensions
You can extend a protocol to provide default implementations of methods or properties.
```swift
extension SomeProtocol {
    func defaultMethod() {
        print("Default method from protocol extension")
    }
}
```
## Using Protocols as Types
Protocols can be used as types, allowing you to create variables or parameters that can hold any type that conforms to the protocol.
```swift
func performAction(with object: SomeProtocol) {
    object.someMethod()
}
```
## Protocols with Associated Types
Protocols can have associated types, which are placeholders for a type that is specified when the protocol is adopted.
```swift
protocol Container {
    associatedtype ItemType
    var items: [ItemType] { get }
    func addItem(_ item: ItemType)
}
struct StringContainer: Container {
    var items: [String] = []

    func addItem(_ item: String) {
        items.append(item)
    }
}
```
## Conclusion
Protocols are a powerful feature in Swift that enable you to define a common interface for different types. They promote code reusability and help in creating flexible and maintainable code. By using protocols, you can create a clear separation of concerns and define clear contracts for your types.

## Best Practices
- Use protocols to define a common interface for related types.
- Prefer protocol-oriented programming over inheritance when possible.
- Use protocol extensions to provide default implementations and reduce code duplication.
- Use associated types to create flexible and reusable protocols.
