The `project.pbxproj` file is not a "section" within Swift code but a configuration file for an Xcode project. It resides inside the YourApp.xcodeproj package and describes:

- **Targets**: Define build targets such as apps, tests, and other executable units.
- **Build Settings**: Specify configurations like Swift versions, compiler flags, and framework paths.
- **File References**: Manage files and folder groups included in the project.
- **Build Phases**: Handle tasks like source compilation, resource copying, and library linking.
- **Build Configurations**: Include Debug, Release, and custom configurations.

The `project.pbxproj` file is essentially a plist file in a custom ASCII format. Xcode reads and writes this file when you add or remove files, change build settings, etc. While manual editing is possible (and sometimes necessary, such as with `objectVersion`), it is generally recommended to let Xcode manage it.

### Why lower `objectVersion`?

By default, Xcode 16 sets the following in `project.pbxproj`:

```text
objectVersion = 70;
```

However, CocoaPods 1.16.2 (specifically its `xcodeproj` gem) does not yet support version 70, resulting in errors. Manually lowering it to:

```text
objectVersion = 60;
```

aligns with the Xcode 15 format, which the gem can read. After downgrading to version 60, running `pod install` completes without errors.
